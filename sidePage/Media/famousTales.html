					<p> Dunkers tale is a sad one. Though one you may recognise. <br /><br />
					
						In the Dunkera Mountain in Fosen, there lived a mountain troll called Dunker. 
						On one of his many walks in the mountain, Dunkers eyes befell a lovely maiden and he at once fell in love.
						To keep her love, Dunker caught the maiden and brought her into the mountain to his home. 						
						Dunker was so in love, he decided they they should marry at once.<br /><br />
					</p>	
					<p>
						So he began to prepare a wedding ceremony. It was a sorry sight, if you were to look in from afar.
						There the maiden is sat crying while dunker prepared the wedding ceremony.
						She pleaded with him and begged him to let her go, but to no avail.
						Dunker was far too in love and would not hear her. <br /><br />
					</p>
					<p>					
						The night before the wedding Dunker was in a very good mood. 
						He drank merrily and became quite exhilarated.						
						For many days the maiden had tried to make him tell her his name but in vain. 
						But now she saw an opportunity and made the mountain troll put his head in her lap. 
						Then she started stroking his hair. <br /><br />
					</p>
					<p>					
						He became so happy that he jumped up, danced and sang: 
						<blockquote>Hey Hey Dunkerydee! Tomorrow for the first time Dunker takes the bride in his arms! </blockquote> 
						
						"No, poor Mr Dunker! I will not be your bride" The maiden exclaimed happily. For she had finally tricked old Dunker.<br />
						
						Upon realisation of what had befallen him, dunker then burst asunder.
						He burst and fell so heavily that the very mountain around then collapsed.<br /><br />

						The young maiden then could walk out and return to her home.						
						And thus ended the life of Dunker. <br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						There are many similarities between this story and the story of <em>Rumplstiltskin</em> 
						who fell to his death at the mention of his name. <br /><br />
						
						So too are there an abundance of similarities in most folklore if you take the time to look.

					<h3 id="Ymir"> Ymir </h3>
					<p>
						Ymer or Ymir, is the oldest known creature in norse mythology. The oldest tale talks of their birth at the joining of the frost world jotunheim and the firey realm of mulspheleim.
						In the beginning, during the great nothing, the frost of jotun and the fire of musphel met in the great void Ginnungagap or the yawning gap.<br /><br />
					</p>
					<p>				
						It is here that life sprang forth in the form of a genderless creature that called itself ymir, Ymir was not the only creature to spring forth.
						At the same time a great cow called Audhumla. Audhumla sustained themselves by licking the ice of Jotun while Ymir was sustained by suckiling from Audhumla.
						This is the origin story of man, Audhumla brought forth a man by licking them free of the Ice Buri the ancestor of the gods.<br /> <br />
					</p>
					<p>
						During this time Ymir slept, and as they slept they gave birth to the male and female giants, from these came Odin and his brothers Vi and Vili
						Growing impatient and restless, stuck in this great void Odin and his brothers decided to murder Ymir and free themselves. and so they did. <br /> <br />
					</p>
					<p>
						From this gruesome end the world of Midgard was created, the oceans from his blood the sky, the stoney beach from his teeth.
						It was on this beach that they brothers created man and woman breathing into the wood they had found on the beach.
						Thus began the story of mankind within the realm of the gods.

				<div class="postTitle">
					<h2 id="Gryla"> Gryla </h2>
					<p> 
						The first mention of the Gryla can be found in the 13th-century, though later she is mentioned in the <em> Poem of Gryla.</em> along with her sons's the Yule lads.
						Though she has appeared in older tales as a troll the link between her and chrsitmas before this poem. <br/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The oldest poems about Grýla describe her as a parasitic beggar who walks around asking parents to give her their disobedient children. 
						Her plans can be thwarted by giving her food or by chasing her away. Originally, she lives in a small cottage, 
						but in later poems she appears to have been forced out of town and into a faraway cave. <br />
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Also according to folklore, Grýla has been married three times. 
						Her third husband Leppalúði is said to be living with her in their cave in the Dimmuborgir lava fields, 
						with the big black Yule Cat and their 13 sons. 						
						Leppalúði is lazy and mostly stays at home in their cave.  <br/> <br />
						
						Gryla on the other hand leaves her cave, hunts children, and carries them home in her giant sack. 
						She devours children as her favorite snack. Her favorite dish is a stew of naughty kids for which she has an insatiable appetite. 
						According to legend, there is never a shortage of food for Grýla. <br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Current-day Grýla has the ability to detect children who are misbehaving year-round.
						During Christmas time, she comes from the mountains to search nearby towns for her meal.
