					<h1 id="Troll"> What is a Troll </h1>
					<p>
						Troll (originates from Old Norse trǫll, also known as þurs in Norse or thurse in Anglo-Saxon) 
						is a class of being in Germanic mythology and Scandinavian folklore.
						They also have cousins or decsendants in old scottish and Irish folklore in the form of The Fae and Trow/Drow.

					<p>
						The meaning of the word troll is unknown. 
						It might have had the original meaning of supernatural or magical with an overlay of malignant and perilous. 
						Another likely suggestion is that it means "someone who behaves violently" 
						In old Swedish law, trolleri was a particular kind of magic intended to do harm. <br /> <br />
						
						It should also be noted that North Germanic terms such as trolldom (witchcraft) and trolla/trylle 
						(perform magic tricks) in modern Scandinavian languages does not imply any connection with the mythical beings. 
						Moreover, in the sources for Norse mythology, troll can signify any uncanny being, including but not restricted to the Norse giants (jötnar). <br /> <br />

						They are essentially a type of monsters found mainly in myth and legend, though these legend have since spread into the realms of fairy tales and fantasy,
						and trolls are now the antagonist in countless popular tales. <br />
					</p>	
					
					<p>	
						Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; 
						In some tales, trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, 
						with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them.
						
						Though in later tales a Troll were given a distinct physiology that consists of a large bulbous nose, wrinkled skin, a tufty tail and an often hunched for						- 
						they are also usually covered in coarse hair and are seen as smelly, stupid and violent.
						This could have been set as a a warning against "wild men" or something unknown, which many feared in the past. <br/><br/>
						
						More humanoid trolls also existed and in general these more humanoid trolls were seen as more pleasant, 
						taking to wearing human clothing and even forming family and friends - in contrast to their ugly, monstrous cousins in the wild. <br/> <br/>
						
						Some Trolls have been described as having more than one head, many tales also include that these heads have been observed arguing with each other. 
						The film TrollHunter does a great job of offering a variety of troll types and characteristics. Which could be worth a look if you're interested. <br/>

					<h1 id="Norse"> Norse / Scandinavian. </h1>
					<p>
						Norse tales have a strong emphasis on oral telling, stories would be told around camp fires or the dinner table,
						with very few actually written down until very recently. <br /> <br />
						
						In these Old Norse tales, trolls are decribed as dwelling in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves,
						live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.
						Trolls were seen as generally malignant and cruel humanoids ranging from gigantic size to humanoid or smaller statures 
						(no one size description can fit them all) and were normally seen as hideously deformed, 
						though they were often depicted with shape-shifting abilities and other magical powers. <br/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Later, in Scandinavian folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, 
						many older tales the word "troll" simply means any number of malicious small-to-mid scale ogres or gnomes:
						
						where they live far from human habitation, 
						are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings. <br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Trolls were also said to be afraid of thunder, 
						which had strong connections to the Norse god <strong><em>Thor</em></strong>, 
						who made a great habit of slaying giants, 
						trolls and other malicious creatures during his rule in Norse mythology. <br/>
					</p>
					<p> 
						Nordic literature, art and music from the romantic era and onwards has adapted trolls in various manners – 
						often in the form of an aboriginal race, endowed with oversized ears and noses. 
						They are often depicted with tails and hairy ears, similar to the ears of lynxes. <br />
					</p>
					
					<p>		
						Trolls are also sometimes associated with particular landmarks, 
						which at times may be explained as formed from a troll exposed to sunlight.  <!--- This could potentially have its own section ---->
						There are a great many troll based landmarks scattered about the norwegian country side.

					<h1 id="Iceland"> Icelandic </h1>
					<p> 
						The Icelandic people have a strong oral tradition of telling folklore stories and tales, similar to their Nordic cousins. 
						They whisper the same hushed bedtime fairy tales of the ‘hidden people’ and elves to their own children. 
						Tale's that could bring delight or inflict nightmares upon the listener. <br />
					</p>
					<p>
						How trolls are depicted in Icelandic tales is virtually identical to those in norse myth, before trolls began to take on a creature in their own right.
						again the similarities may persist because Iceland was inhabited by ancient norse people.
						Trolls in Iceland appear to look as though human, though they live in a parallel dimension and can make themselve visible at will. <br />
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Similarly, as with norse myth, trolls in Iceland have a strong connection to the environment, 
						both regions also contain tales where trolls seem to be on the hunt for children. 
						This may have been used to keep them from being disobedient or to be a warning for whoever would wander to far or too deep into a dangerous area.					
						Icelandic tales are also full of bumbling goofy characters that perfrom tricks and pranks. 
						Though still contain that quick mean streak and can be quite dangerous if one is not careful. <br/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						There are certain Trolls in Iceland are typically associated with christmas, these are the tales of the 13 Yule lads who are proficienct tricksters.
						They have fun names like sausage-swiper and Bowl-licker which can tell the the sort of hijinx they get up to.
						In older tales, while they were very tricksy, they also enjoyed eating wayward or disobedient children.
						Though their more modern interpretations are still tricksy, they more enjoy rewarding good children over gobbling them up. <br />
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Gryla on the other hand is a Horrifying interpretation of a Troll character, She is the mother of the Yule lads,
						and her tal is alos typically told at christmas time in Iceland.
						Gryla comes from norse myth where she is a giant or jotun, but in iceland she is described as a begger,
						who walks the streets asking parents to give up their disobedient children.
						
						You can read more of her in our stories section.

					<h1 id="German"> German </h1>
					<p> 
						A lot of german folklore come from the Grimms brothers fairytales, these tales have a mix of pre-christian folklore coupled with elements of norse myth. 
						Many tales from these german folk lores bare a striking resemblance to those from troll myth, including the tale of <strong><em>Rumplestiltskin.</em></strong>
						A creature that is said to drop dead at the uttering of his own name from another.
						This tale is near word for word the tale of <strong><em>Dunker</em></strong> the troll who burst asunder once he heard his own name.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						It should be noted that though North Germanic terms such as trolldom (witchcraft) and trolla/trylle (perform magic tricks) 
						are used in modern Scandinavian languages, these terms do not imply any connection with the mythical beings.  
						Moreover, in the sources for Norse mythology, the term troll can signify any uncanny being, including but not restricted to the Norse giants (jötnar). <br />
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So while it may seem that these tales are unique, they may have stemmed from the same origin and simply blended into the the local cultures.
						Becoming changes and adatped over time, in tune with what was going on in that particuale area at the time.

					<h1 id="Irish"> Irish / Scottish </h1>
					
					 <h2> Scottish </h2>
					<p> 
						
						Similarly with German Folk Lore the Irish and the Scottish have very similar tales though they do not use the term Troll. 
						In the Shetland and Orkney islands, Celtic areas once settled by Scandinavians, 
						trolls are called trows and appear as small malignant creatures who dwell in mounds or near the sea. <br /> <br />
						
						An example in scottish folklore is a creature known as the kelpie; 
						resembles a horse covered in seeweed and in attempts to lure unsuspecting victims to a watery grave. <br /> <br />
						
						This is very simiar to the seatroll or water troll, or the Danish "Nixie" or the scandinavian "bäckahästa".
						All	creatures covered in moss or seaweed, all hiding in some watery area waiting to lure people to the depths. <br/>
					</p>
					
					<p>					
						As we've learned if you've read other areas in this blog the term troll can signify any uncanny being. 
						We could assume then, that these tales simply borrowed from one another or began as the same tale told and retold across the centuries,
						and as they were told and adapted the evolved into their own unique stories over time.
					</p>
					
					<hr>
					
					<h2> Irish </h2>
					
					<p>
						When the ancestors of the modern Irish, the Milesians, arrived in Ireland the inhabitants, known as the Tuatha de Dannan, retreated into the otherworld. 
						This otherworld was commonly seen as being somewhere else on Earth, with underground being one of those places. 
						These "fairy mounds" or "sidhe" are the homes of the fairies. I don't know when the fairies began taking on the characteristics of things like trolls etc. 
						but they are the mythological "descendants" of the older race of beautiful and powerful divine beings. <br/>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						All of these tales have one particular thing in common, they all seem to be warnings: <br /><br/>
							"Don't stray too far into the woods, there are trolls" <br />
							"Don't go too near the water the Kelpie waits!" Etc. Etc...<br /> <br/>
							
						These tales also show us what great imagination people can have, 
						and how a tale told over a thousand years ago around a camp fire somewhere in the darkest woods.
						Can persist until today and be told to our own children and their children for as long as time.
